"""TransitionReceipt: the ONE canonical output (northstar §3).

Everything meaningful emits the same artifact: canonical JSON, hashed,
signed (signature field carried; key management lives above the kernel).
`transition()` is the ONLY path from proposal to canonical state:

    S[t+1] = T(S[t], P)  iff  ALL gates PASS  (northstar §1)

No gate pass, no transition. No prose anywhere in the artifact
(invariant 8). Receipts carry proof_level V0..V12 (northstar §5);
authority maps capability -> minimum level.
